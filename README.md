<h1 align="center"> EFFECT OF DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION USING SVD ON SPEECH SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION</h1>

## Description

This project is about the effect of SVD on speech signal classification. All tests were performed using the Alex-Net ANN architecture to get fair results for all tested methods. The voice used was cut into 1-second segments to make the data uniform.

### About the dataset:

The dataset we use is a The voice signal used during testing uses the speech command dataset created by Google.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/?downloads)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

## Download and Installation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine by either clicking on clone button or you can do it form git bash or linux terminal using following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/dunasi4139/Speech-Signal-Classification-with-SVD-ANN.git
```

2. Once you have codes on your local machine now run jupyter on your machine then upload the code and respective dataset to jupyter home.
3. Now you have codes in your jupyter repository or folder now you can see your project on home in jupyter now click on and a new windows with browser will be opened up now click run button and you will see the results.
